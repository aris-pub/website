# Beyond the PDF: Why Academic Publishing Needs a Web-Native Future

*January 15, 2024 • Aris Team*

The Portable Document Format (PDF) was revolutionary when Adobe introduced it in 1993. For the first time, researchers could share documents that looked identical across different computers and operating systems. This consistency was exactly what academic publishing needed in the transition from print to digital.

But three decades later, we're still trapped in a format designed for paper, not pixels.

## The PDF Problem

PDFs were designed to replicate the print experience digitally. They excel at preserving layout and ensuring documents look the same everywhere. But this strength has become a weakness in our mobile-first, interactive world:

- **Mobile Experience**: Try reading a PDF on your phone. You'll spend more time pinching and zooming than actually reading.
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers struggle with PDFs, excluding researchers with visual impairments.
- **Searchability**: Content is locked in static files, invisible to modern search and discovery tools.
- **Collaboration**: Commenting and annotation are clunky afterthoughts, not native features.
- **Preservation**: Binary formats are fragile. Link rot is real, and PDFs break.

## What Web-Native Means

Web-native publishing means embracing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as first-class formats for academic content. This isn't about putting PDFs online—it's about rethinking how scholarly communication works:

### Responsive by Default
Content that adapts to any screen size, from smartwatches to ultra-wide monitors. The same document is readable whether you're commuting on your phone or presenting on a projector.

### Accessible by Design
Semantic HTML works with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies out of the box. Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's inherent.

### Interactive Content
Embed live code, interactive visualizations, and dynamic figures. Let readers explore your data, not just look at static screenshots.

### Version Control
Every change is tracked. Readers can see exactly what changed between versions, authors can collaborate like developers, and the history of ideas is preserved.

### Permanent Links
URLs that work forever. Deep linking to specific sections, figures, or even individual sentences. Citation that actually takes you to the exact content being referenced.

## The Tools Are Ready

The technology for web-native publishing isn't hypothetical—it exists today:

- **Semantic Markup**: Formats like RSM (Readable Science Markup) preserve meaning while enabling rich presentation.
- **Static Site Generators**: Tools like 11ty, Hugo, and Jekyll make it easy to publish fast, accessible websites.
- **Version Control**: Git provides robust collaboration and version tracking for text-based formats.
- **CDNs and Web Standards**: Modern web infrastructure is more reliable and faster than ever.

## Making the Transition

The path forward isn't about abandoning PDFs overnight. It's about building bridges:

1. **Start with HTML**: Author in formats that prioritize content structure over visual layout.
2. **Generate PDFs**: Use web standards to create PDFs when needed, not as the primary format.
3. **Embrace Progressive Enhancement**: Start with accessible, semantic HTML and layer on interactivity.
4. **Build for Longevity**: Choose open standards over proprietary formats.

## The Future is Already Here

Research institutions, preprint servers, and forward-thinking journals are already making this transition. The question isn't whether academic publishing will become web-native—it's how quickly we can build the infrastructure to support it.

At Aris, we're building that infrastructure. Tools that make it easy to create, share, and preserve knowledge in formats designed for the web, not the printing press.

The post-PDF era isn't coming. It's here.
