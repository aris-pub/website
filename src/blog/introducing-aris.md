# Introducing Aris: Infrastructure for the Post-PDF Era

*July 24, 2025 • Aris Team*

Academic publishing is broken.

Not in the dramatic, "everything must burn" sense, but in the quiet, everyday frustrations that compound over time. You've felt it: squinting at PDFs on your phone, losing track of comments scattered across email threads, watching valuable discussions disappear after conferences end, seeing brilliant research locked away in static files that search engines can barely understand.

We've all adapted to these limitations because, well, this is just how scholarly communication works. But it doesn't have to be.

## What We're Building

Aris is infrastructure for the post-PDF era. We're not trying to replace everything overnight—we're building bridges from where academic publishing is today to where it needs to be tomorrow.

Our first two tools embody this philosophy:

**Preview Press** is a modern preprint server designed for web-native research. Instead of forcing you to squeeze everything into PDF constraints, it accepts documents in any HTML format and gives them permanent URLs, version tracking, and community discussions. Your research can finally be as dynamic and interactive as your ideas.

**RSM Studio** is a collaborative editor for RSM (Readable Science Markup)—a format that preserves the meaning of your content while enabling beautiful presentation across all devices. Write once, publish everywhere, from mobile phones to printed pages, with the semantic structure intact.

## Why This Matters

For too long, scientific communication has been trapped in formats designed for paper, not pixels. We've all struggled with PDFs on phones, lost context in email threads, watched valuable discussions vanish after conferences. Knowledge gets locked in static files while the world has moved to dynamic, interconnected information.

The tools of knowledge should be as thoughtful as the knowledge itself.

## Our Principles

Everything we build stands on four foundational principles:

**Universal**: Works on any device, for any user, in any context. Online or offline. No barriers to access.

**Transparent**: Your research, your control. Everything is exportable, versionable, and built on open standards.

**Interactive**: Research is conversation. Our tools enable dialogue, feedback, and knowledge that builds over time.

**Inviting**: Beautiful, effortless experiences that respect your time and let you focus on what matters.

## The Journey Ahead

We're starting with researchers who are already frustrated with the status quo—those who've tried to make PDFs interactive, who've wished for better collaboration tools, who believe that academic publishing can and should work better.

This is just the beginning. Over the coming months, we'll be sharing our thinking on web-native publishing, demonstrating new features, and building in public. We'll explore what it means to preserve knowledge for the long term, how to make research truly accessible, and why the future of academic communication is already here—it's just not evenly distributed yet.

## A Vision Worth Pursuing

Yes, Aris's vision is ambitious and grandiose. It needs to be, for science deserves no less.

We're not just building better tools—we're reimagining how human knowledge is created, shared, and preserved. That's not a small undertaking, and we don't pretend otherwise. But the alternative is accepting that the most important conversations of our time will continue to happen in formats designed for a world that no longer exists.

Science has always been about pushing boundaries, asking "what if," and refusing to accept that things must stay as they are. Why should the tools of science be any different?

## Join Us

The post-PDF era isn't a distant future—it's a choice we can make today. Every time we prioritize accessibility over visual consistency, collaboration over control, open standards over proprietary formats, we're building that future.

If you're ready to move beyond the limitations of print-era thinking, we'd love to have you join us. Try Preview Press for your next preprint. Experiment with RSM Studio for collaborative writing. Share your thoughts on what academic publishing should become.

The infrastructure for better scholarly communication is here. Let's build something better together.
